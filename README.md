This repository contains the source code of the external Server, which was build using **.NET 5**.<br/>(for an project overview see [SmartGardeningSystem](https://github.com/Bernd-H/DA_SmartGardeningSystem))

# ExternalServer
The exteral server of the gardening system ensures that all connected basestations get weather forecasts and historic weather data. The external Server exchanges also connect information from the mobile app to the basestation and relays packages when a direct communication from the mobile app to the basestation is not possible (because of a NAT for example).
