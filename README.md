This repository contains the source code of the external Server, which was build using **.NET 5**.<br/>(for a project overview see [SmartGardeningSystem](https://github.com/Bernd-H/DA_SmartGardeningSystem))

# ExternalServer
The external server of the gardening system ensures that all connected basestations get weather forecasts and historic weather data. The external Server also exchanges information to connect a mobile app to a specific basestation and relays packages when a direct connection from the mobile app to the basestation is not possible (because of a NAT for example).
